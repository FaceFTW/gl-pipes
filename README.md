# gl-pipes
An OSS Implementation/semi-port of the Windows 3D pipes screensaver for Linux

## Disclaimers

A lot of the original logic/design comes from the original source code for the screensaver in the [Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SDK](https://winworldpc.com/download/3d03c2ad-c2ad-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef) found under `MSTOOLS\SAMPLES\OPENGL\SCRSAVE` (shoutouts to [1j01](https://github.com/1j01/pipes) for even listing this link on his JS implementation). This repo does not contain a complete copy of that sample, but rather will have snippets from that sample code that will be used. For all intensive purposes, the only code that is mine would be ***TBD***.

I make no claims that the general logic is mine, I'm just reworking it so that it works under Linux. Shoot me an email or something if you are a lawyer and want me to take this down, I'll happily oblige.

Also, this is my first foray into OpenGL. Its going to suck initially, but wait a bit for me to get a grasp on whatever the heck the GL calls do.
