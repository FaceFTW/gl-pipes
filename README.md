# gl-pipes
An WIP Implementation/semi-port of the Windows 3D pipes screensaver in Rust

## Reference Material

A lot of the original logic/design comes from the original source code for the screensaver in the [Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SDK](https://winworldpc.com/download/3d03c2ad-c2ad-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef) found under `MSTOOLS\SAMPLES\OPENGL\SCRSAVE` (shoutouts to [1j01](https://github.com/1j01/pipes) for even listing this link on his JS implementation)
